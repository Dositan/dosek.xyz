# 2022 Summary

it’s 2AM in the morning of 29th of December, hello everyone.

I’ve done many things during this year, and I’m writing this document in order to remember all of the achievements I’ve accomplished, participated and helped in 2022.

I believe by giving feedback to myself I’ll become much more powerful in 2023, so let’s get started.

# January

Looking through my phone gallery I can tell that my lazy ass hasn’t completed a thing during this month. A lot of celebration of the opening year, non-stop try-hard studying and a couple of pictures of me and my friends.

# February

Nothing at all, I’ve only found board pictures (this period I was taking a ton of photos, probably lazy to write or idk) - but you can instantly tell that my studying methods weren’t the best. I’ve wrote, read a lot but didn’t to understand much - or couldn’t understand much with the help of 5-hour sleep.

# March

- **8th** - International Women’s Day. Me and my family spent time together during this holiday.
- **17th** - Bauyrsaq Day due to upcoming Nauryz holidays.
- **20th** - trip to Taraz with family. This city had lots of unrevealed details that I discovered to myself, beautiful city.
- **21st** - trip to Turkestan. Right after going through Taraz’s sightseeings we considered going to the place we were originally planning to stay at - the birthplace of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi. The infrastructure of that place was growing blazingly fast due to a lot of projects and programs aiming to develop tourism here. Keruen Sarai was amazing.
- **25th** - for the first time in my life beat Minecraft survival mode without any cheat or external help.
- **29th** - a light rain contributed to the whole drowning of Almaty, this time I understood that city management is weak asf.

# April

- **2nd** - for some reason, this was the day we celebrated Nauryz at school. Huge fairs, free traditional food and many more. I think I’ve played a role on one scene.
- **8th** - my little brother’s birthday. Nothing special, just had fun with family at a restaurant. FYI, this was the day I broke my lower jaw in 2018.
- **9th** - me and my friend Bek went to forum of foreign schools. We were hugely disappointed by the list of schools that didn’t provide tuitions or were available to study for only a year.
- **11th** - one of the few times I had fun at art class. The whole class was doing painting work with chalks and only. It was good, pink n purple colors do make an impact
- **17th** - was a perfect day to play football with friends, which I did. Me, Aliman and Bek were chilling on a roof, took some photos and got a W at the match.
- **24th** - my first serious steps into web development. I was learning Django at the time, was really enjoying it, however I lacked skills at the frontend part, I was simply refusing to learn HTML+CSS
- **29th** - my first ever hackathon. It was organized in our school and was named HackNIS. Amazing experience, amazing case and amazing opportunities with free food :)
- **30th** - MVP at hackathon already done, the results came but we were hugely misunderstood by the judges which made some impact on our scores.

# May

- **10th** - trip to Taraz once again, but this time for a reason. My grandpa and grandma celebrated their 60th anniversary of marriage.
- **11th** - visited undiscovered places

Before we go further, I’d like to remind you that I kind of have 2 birthdays - 13th and 15th of May, where in 13th I was born and was documented as 15th. Technically 2 legit days of celebration.

- **13th** - me and my friends went to MEGA, Burger King. We completely abused its promotion of scanning your check for one medium french fries box. We had 7ish checks, showed all of them except for me - I had a feeling of getting yelled at. **In the evening** I went to a restaurant where all of my family was waiting for me. We had a great dinner, talked about things and had a good time in general.
- **25th** - last bell at school. Everybody was given a snickers and an ice-cream. Can’t remember much, I went straight home, probably planning to work on Jazbahana.
- **26th** - start of the summer school, that lasted a week.

# June

- **1st** - visit to Daryn.Online, talked about how they work etc.
- **3rd to 5th** - trip to Kolsay and Kaindy lakes with my class. Amazing nature, amazing time having fun with people you spend most of your time with and just an amazing experience traveling without parents.
- **11th** - went to a forum in our school with amazing speakers who talked about universities, application and how they made it to the top.

# July

- **1st to 9th** - trip to Egypt, Sharm El Sheikh. Can’t tell much, miraculous time.
- **14th** - trip to aul, Qonyrolen. Had fun with cousins.
- **27th** - went to a business meeting at Forum Business.

# August

- **7th** - went to HomeClub with my family
- **14th** - went to my cousin’s Uzatu

The remaining part of August I was trying to spent time having fun, well, I don’t really know but there was nothing at all in my gallery.

# September

- **1st** - beginning of 10th grade. I told to myself that I’ll be grinding no matter what, applied a lot of limits to my everyday life and actually saw the results right away.
- The whole September was just studying - studying effectively.

# October

- **31st** - omw to Astana.

# November

- **1st** - just arrived in Astana, dormitory room setup, exploring local buildings.
- **2nd** - excursion at Nazarbayev University which appeared to be an amazing place with amazing labs to work at.
- **3rd** - excursion at Astana IT University
- **4th** - probably the only day we had a bit of free time, that we spent on going to Mega SilkWay. I took a photo with a legendary corruption sightseeing - LRT.
- **5th** - going back home.

- 24th - Dos Mukasan’s Murat Kusainov visited our school

# December

# Feedback

Well, as you can see, this year was full of pivots and periods when I was terribly exhausted and didn’t want to do anything at all. Next year I’m planning on changing my discipline completely so I won’t depend on motivation, only non-stop self-improvement. Wish me luck!
