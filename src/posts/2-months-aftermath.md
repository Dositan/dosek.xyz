Hey everyone. As you can see the school (10th grade) has already started. I'm alive, confused with what decisions to make and desperate to take vital actions in order to survive school.

# What's going on today?

The academic year started good actually. I and some other guys formed a club, me and a friend of mine are doing Science Project work for Jazbahana. I get -2 witches still but I was enjoying the studying process.

I recently broke my cell phone so I'm using Nokia XPress Music today :D and you know, this helped me a lot in creating a new mindset, changing the way of studying and switched my points of view on the educational system of our society.

You know, it's a solid feeling when you effortlessly understand a topic -> take notes in the process -> go home -> take a look at the notes -> do your business -> go to sleep early.

By the way, look what Midjourney AI generated for me today! ("a warrior of the steppe")

School isn't tough, but takes extreme amount of time (I literally wake up to school at 5:30AM and arrive home at 6:30PM)

The 1st term is coming to an end, the president election has finished (congrats @nis.aleph) and the exams are about to begin.

The SAT week starts tomorrow, so wish me luck (I really hope  anxiety won't hit randomly)
