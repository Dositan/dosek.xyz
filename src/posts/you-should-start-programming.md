# Hey everyone, Dastan is here.

I've been learning to code for the last 2-3 years and the learning curve was sometimes intense and sometimes I kept forgetting how the syntax works.

In those 3 years I've learnt tons of different technologies, Python, Web Development, Building CLI Tools, Game Development, Discord Bots, Telegram Bots and many more.

And now I want to explain why you should start programming right now!

# It's Exciting

Programming is a field where you can see all the results visually. It's not only for web development, in machine learning as an example, you can see your model defining whether the displayed image is a hotdog or not.

# No Math

If your biggest obstacle for getting started in programming is Math, trust me, there is no Math at all except for specific fields where calculations are based on that field.

If you want to build cross-platform apps for example, you can start immediately with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

I recommend to check Sarah Mei's article 'Programming Is Not Math' where it's explained in-depth: [Programming Is Not Math](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/07/15/programming-is-not-math/).

# You Just Need A Laptop

Not even a laptop! If you have a device that supports a technology you want to learn, then you're capable of gathering knowledge! Programming is a Football of Science with a single requirement to get you started. ![Nokia Snake Game](https://admin.itsnicethat.com/images/OIjxNdWZjDBxGO8G63riG0GcbPM=/200895/format-webp%7Cwidth-1440/Extra_nice__2021__snake_imagery___3_c4xEYPC.jpg)

# What Do I Need to Learn?

It's really up to you. I recommend to find a specific field based on your interests and motivation (not money pls). Don't know where to start? Learn [Python](https://python.org/). Wanna go low-level? Check out [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/). Maybe Game Development of some kind? [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/).

If you're lost, know that it doesn't hardly matter whether you start from a certain language. Once you master something, it'll become much easier to cover other technologies, since they're all similar to some extent.
