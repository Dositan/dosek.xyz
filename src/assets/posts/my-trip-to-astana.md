Hey there. 2nd quarter has already started, and I spent my whole holiday in Astana, country's capital attending on competition with [Jazbahana](https://jazbahana.dosek.xyz/).

# What Competition?

Daryn - national competition of science projects, where all ideas and products get assessed by a bunch of PhD's depending on what subject you specialize in.

I and my teammate Bek attended to Computer Science, hoping for the best. However, it didn't go quite well. The project seemed extremely similar to other social media platforms, whilst one of our main goals was to isolate a student from the social media addiction.

# What Happened?

This field was extremely competitive with 18 projects where most of them use Firebase + Machine Learning algorithms on their prototype devices. Bro one team made their own 'Ok, Google'. I initially realized that we wouldn't stand a chance against those kind of projects, but tried to at least get 3rd place. Failed.

# Conclusion

I made a lot of friends throughout this week-long competition and I realized that if there is an idea, rather be it difficult or not it's achievable, the point is to have good planning from the beginning.
