# What is Tapsyr?

[Tapsyr](https://tapsyr.dosek.xyz) is a task manager app that I decided to build to challenge my knowledge I gained in the last 2 months (when I seriously got into web dev).

You only need to Sign in with Google and ready to go. At **/tasks** you'll see a list-card that will contain all of your to-dos.

# About the Tech Stack

Tapsyr is built on top of [t3 stack](https://init.tips/), including Next.js, tRPC, Prisma, TailwindCSS and it has a database hosted on PlanetScale.

# UX and DX

## User Experience:

I posted about Tapsyr on my [Instagram](https://instagram/dastanozgeldi) where everyone liked the design. As of today though, Tapsyr has a couple of issues on server-side management that are yet to be resolved.

## Developer Experience:

The experience I got while developing Tapsyr was absolutely amazing. **Strongly-typed APIs**, **Clear and Concise Documentations**, the **Design Choice** - that was a match made in **heaven**. I strongly recommend you to try using [t3 stack](https://init.tips/)

# Conclusion

Tapsyr is one of the projects where everything went smoothly - from early stage to right into deployment. I really enjoyed the process and got encouraged to build more complex projects that would make the world a better place.
