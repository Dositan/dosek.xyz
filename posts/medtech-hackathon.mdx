Hi. I spent the last weekend with my team at online hackathon that was set in Qaragandy. Here is my feedback on it (very opinionated).

# My team.

My team consisted of amazing people: Bek, Daryn and Darkhan (dream team isn't it). We procrastinated a lot and have done most of the job the last 6 hours. In the end the experience was amazing and we worked on the project 12 hours a day together.

# The case.

The case was really weird considering the fact it didn't even seem like a case. It was more like a task to complete so sponsors could use it in production. I and my team selected the 2nd case about building a forum for pregnant mothers to get feedback from specialists as fast as possible. There were a lot of criterias, such as gallery, marketplace, user profile etc. everything in Russian with fancy design in 2 days ðŸ¥³. We eventually made it but didn't win for the reason they're not revealing.

# The organization is terrible.

I understand that this is an online hackathon and sponsors had to deal with offline teams, but still, the cases were as if the organizators didn't even know what a hackathon means. They were just project criterias and everybody struggled a lot to fit into them.

## Time management

We had a time schedule that was just a word doc. This is like the worst option that neither notifies participants nor organizes them.

## Webex

What is webex? We had to install it just for these meetings. Why not use Google Meet or Zoom? Webex! Inconvenient.

## The judges.

Apparently we noticed that all winners of the med. hackathon were participating offline which means judges might not been listening to online teams. I can say that because our team had a working MVP both website and mobile app and still teams with drawings of pregnant women managed to win.

## The results.

Results are still unknown to this day. The organizators won't reveal details, feedback from judges or just answer questions. Complete ignore. This is already a sign of injustice in my opinion.
